# Recipe-Management-System
created a web application called the Recipe Management System. This system will help users organize and manage their favourite recipes. Users will be able to: • Add new recipes with their name, type of cuisine, and list of ingredients. • View all their saved recipes in one place. • Edit or delete recipes when needed.
